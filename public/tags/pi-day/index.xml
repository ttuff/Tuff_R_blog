      <description>Happy Pi Day everyone!! Since the date today approximates pi (3.14), I thought I would celebrate by deriving an approximation of pi using light sabors.  We start in a futuristic world where urban wildlife have aquired light sabors and taken over Montreal. Future squirels battle for food scraps near homeless man’s dome tent
 To battle these savage beasts, we must learn to make our own light sabor.

      <title>Calculate pi by throwing needles</title>

      <description>Suppose that you drop a short needle on ruled paper, what is then the probability that the needle comes to lie in a position where it crosses one of the lines? - Georges Buffon, 1777
When the needle is the right length, the answer is pi!
Here is a quick example in R of approximating the value of Pi by digitally tossing a box of matches onto a sheet of lined paper.</description>

      <description>Happy Pi Day everyone!! Today is 3-14, and those numbers are the first three digits of Pi. To celebrate, I estimated Pi using a lightsaber battle. I first build an army of saber-wielding critters in La Fountaine park, then I cut 6 transects across the battlefield and count the number of contacts I make with critter-sabers along the way. After the battle, I take a ratio of hits vs. misses to estimate Pi.</description>

      <description>Suppose that you drop a short needle on ruled paper, what is then the probability that the needle comes to lie in a position where it crosses one of the lines? - Georges Buffon, 1777
When the needle is the right length, the answer is pi!
Here is a quick example in R of approximating the value of Pi by digitally tossing a box of matches onto a sheet of lined paper.</description>

      <description>Happy Pi Day everyone!! Since the date today approximates pi (3.14), I thought I would celebrate by deriving an approximation of pi using light sabors.  We start in a futuristic world where urban wildlife have aquired light sabors and taken over Montreal.  Figure 1: Future squirels battle for food scraps near homeless manâ€™s dome tent.  To battle these savage beasts, we must learn to make our own light sabor.</description>

      <description>Suppose that you drop a short needle on ruled paper, what is then the probability that the needle comes to lie in a position where it crosses one of the lines? - Georges Buffon, 1777
When the needle is the right length, the answer is pi!
Here is a quick example in R of approximating the value of Pi by digitally tossing a box of matches onto a sheet of lined paper.</description>
